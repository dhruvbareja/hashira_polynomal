# Hashira Placements Assignment â€“ Polynomial Solver

### ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
We are given JSON input containing polynomial roots in different bases.  
The task is to:
1. Parse the roots from the JSON.  
2. Convert them into decimal values.  
3. Use the first **k** roots (where `k = m+1`, and `m` = degree of polynomial).  
4. Construct the polynomial by multiplying terms of the form `(x - root)`.  
5. Output the coefficients and the final polynomial.
